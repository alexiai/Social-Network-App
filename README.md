## 🧠 My Work

This application was entirely developed by me as a personal university project.  
It showcases my abilities in:

- Designing and implementing an entire desktop application from scratch
- Creating a clean, responsive user interface with JavaFX and FXML
- Implementing core social media logic: friend requests, messaging, user sessions
- Structuring large Java codebases using best practices (clean architecture, modularity, validators)
- Working with databases and integrating SQL queries
- Exporting PDF reports and using Java threading for UI responsiveness
